Create complex objects step by step,
    with readable,
    maintainable,
    and flexible code
without constructor overloads

Eg:
    new User("John", "Doe", 25, ""eg@gmail.com", "address");
What if you want to provide SOME VALUES, and keep others as DEFAULT

Use case:
    -> User profile having optional fields
    -> Creating HTTP requests
    -> Setting up an immutable configuration object

Two ways we can create Builder patter:
    1. inner static class builder
        - new User.Builder().age(30)...
        - used in JavaBeans, POJO's
    2. external public class builder
        - new Jwts.builder().setObject("abc)...
        - Libraries like JJWT, OkHttp
