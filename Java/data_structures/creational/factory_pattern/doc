Create objects without specifying the exact class name, using a factory method.

ADVANTAGES:
    All creation logic is in one place
    Open for extension, closed for modification
    Decouples creation logic -> You never use new Class() outside the factory

Real-time use case:
    Notification system - creates correct notifier
    Parsing file formats(JSON, XML, CSV) - returns the appropriate parser
    Creating different types of UI buttons (WindowsButton, MacButton)
