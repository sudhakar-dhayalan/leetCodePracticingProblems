1. Prefix sum pattern
    Range sum query - immutable
    Contiguous array
    Subarray sum equals k
2. Two pointers pattern
    palindrome
    two sum || - Input array is sorted
    3sum
    container with most water
3. Sliding window (sub array, sub string)
     Maximum Average Subarray
     Longest substring without repeating characters
     Minimum window substring
4. Fast and slow pointers (variant of 2 pointers)
    Linked list cycle
    Happy number
    Find the duplicate number
5. Linked list in-place reversal
    Reverse linked list
    Reverse linked list ||
    Swap nodes in pair
